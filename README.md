# AQSVC_German_Credit_data

**AQSVC_German_Credit_Data.ipynb** includes my solutions for both Part 1 and Part 2.

The **German_Preprocessed_Data.csv** is the reorganized version of the original dataset where the values are all numerical and features with alphanumeric codes were made into seperate features.

The **German_Selected_Features.csv** was initially used to filter out features based on their correlation to the target.

The **German_Adjusted_Features.csv** is currently used to further filter the features to focus more on features strongly correlated with the target minority class.
